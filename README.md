# NetflixAutoSkipIntroduction
A Chrome extension that automatically skips the Netflix introduction / credits for you.


Installation:
go to chrome://extensions/, drag the .crx to the webpage. If this doesn't work:
Extract the .crx with unzipper of your choice, enable developer mode, select "load unpacked", and select the folder where the .crx was unzipped to.

For Safari:
I do not have a Apple Developer Certificate. The files are there, feel free to build it yourself.

For now users must manually check for updates.
