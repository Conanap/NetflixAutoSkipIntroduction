# NetflixAutoSkipIntroduction
A Chrome extension that automatically skips the Netflix introduction / credits for you.


Installation:
go to chrome://extensions/, drag the .crx to the webpage. If this doesn't work:
Extract the .crx with unzipper of your choice, enable developer mode, select "load unpacked", and select the folder where the .crx was unzipped to.


For now users must manually check for updates.
