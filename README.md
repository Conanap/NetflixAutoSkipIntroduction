# NetflixAutoSkipIntroduction
NOTE: Does not work with updated Netflix interface; working on a fix. Also no guarantee to work with Mojave due to new API implementations. Unlikely to be updated for.

A Chrome extension that automatically skips the Netflix introduction / credits for you.


Installation:
go to chrome://extensions/, extract with unzipper of your choice, enable developer mode, select "load unpacked", and select the folder where the .zip was unzipped to.

For Safari:
I do not have an Apple Developer Certificate. The files are there, feel free to build it yourself.

For now users must manually check for updates.
